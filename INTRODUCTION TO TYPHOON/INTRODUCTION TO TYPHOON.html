<h1>INTRODUCTION TO TYPHOONS!!</h1>
    <p>A tropical cyclone is a generic term for a low-pressure system over tropical or sub-tropical waters, with organized convection (i.e. thunderstorm activity) and winds at low levels circulating either anti-clockwise (in the northern hemisphere) or clockwise (in the southern hemisphere). The whole storm system may be five to six miles high and 300 to 400 miles wide, although sometimes can be even bigger. It typically moves forward at speeds of 10-15 m.p.h., but can travel as fast as 40 m.p.h. At its very early and weak stages, it is called a Tropical Depression. When the winds reach 39 m.p.h. it is called a Tropical Storm. If the wind should reach 74 m.p.h. or more the tropical storm is called a Hurricane in the Atlantic and the eastern North Pacific or a Typhoon in the western North Pacific. In other parts of the world, such as the Indian Ocean and South Pacific the term Cyclone or Tropical Cyclone is used.
    </p>
<h1>HOW DO THEY FORM?</h1>
 <p>In the tropics, there is a broad zone of low pressure that stretches either side of the equator. The winds on the north side of this zone blow from the northeast (the northeast trades) and on the southern side blow from the southeast (south-east trades).
  Within this area of low pressure, the air is heated over the warm tropical ocean. This air rises in discrete parcels, causing thundery showers to form. 
  These showers usually come and go, but from time to time, they group together into large clusters of thunderstorms. 
  This creates a flow of very warm, moist, rapidly rising air, leading to the development of a center of low pressure, or depression, at the surface.
  There are various trigger mechanisms required to transform these cloud clusters into tropical cyclone. These trigger mechanisms depend on several conditions being 'right' at the same time. The most influential factors are:
</p>
      
<div class="container">
  <p>1. a source of warm, moist air derived from tropical oceans with sea surface temperatures normally in the region of, or in excess, of 27 Â°C;</p>
  <p> 2. winds near the ocean surface blowing from different directions converging and causing air to rise and storm clouds to form;</p>
  <p> 2. winds near the ocean surface blowing from different directions converging and causing air to rise and storm clouds to form;</p>
  <p>4. sufficient distance from the equator to provide spin or twist.</p>

</div>

<p>
The Coriolis force caused by the rotation of the Earth helps the spin of this column of rising air. 
The development of the surface depression causes an increase in the strength of the trade winds. 
The spiraling winds accelerate inwards and upwards, releasing heat and moisture as they do so.
As the depression strengthens it becomes a tropical storm and then a hurricane or typhoon. 
A mature hurricane or typhoon takes the form of a cylinder of deep thunderclouds around a center that is relatively free from clouds.
</p>
<p>
There is a relatively small area of intense horizontal winds at the surface, often well over 100 m.p.h., while air rises strongly above, maintaining the deep cumulonimbus clouds.
Further aloft at about six miles, the cloud tops are carried outwards to give thick layer of clouds due to the outward-spiraling winds leaving the tropical cyclone core. 
At the center of the tropical cyclone, the air is subsiding, which makes it dry and often cloud-free, and there is little or no wind at the surface. This is called the eye of the storm.

<h1>IMPACTS:</h1>
<p>The impacts of a typhoon can be devastating. They can cause strong winds, heavy rains, and storm surges that can lead to flooding, landslides, and widespread damage to infrastructure and property. Typhoons can also cause loss of life, displacement of people, and disruptions to essential services like water and electricity.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>Typhoons can also give you Diseases due to contaminated water, lack of sanitation, and overcrowding in shelters. The common diseases that typhoons could give you are:</p>
<p>1. Diarrhea: Typhoons can cause flooding and damage to water systems, leading to contamination of drinking water sources. This can result in an outbreak of diarrhea, which can be life-threatening, especially for young children and the elderly.</p>
<p>Leptospirosis: This is a bacterial infection that can occur through contact with contaminated water or soil. It can cause flu-like symptoms, including fever, headache, muscle pain, and vomiting.</p>
<p>Dengue fever: Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that can cause severe flu-like symptoms, including high fever, headache, and joint pain. The risk of dengue fever can increase after a typhoon due to the accumulation of standing water, which can become a breeding ground for mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Cholera: Cholera is a bacterial infection that can cause severe diarrhea and dehydration. It is commonly spread through contaminated water and can be fatal if left untreated.</p>
<p>Tetanus: Typhoons can cause injuries that can increase the risk of tetanus, a bacterial infection that affects the nervous system. This can occur through exposure to contaminated soil or objects.</p>

<h1>FUN FACTS ABOUT TYPHOONS!</h1>
<p>1. A revolving tropical storm system that originates at sea is what causes typhoons, cyclones, and hurricanes, among other weather-related terms. Simply said, how it is named depends on where in the world it forms. </p>
<p>2. A typhoon or hurricane's eye can range in size from 3.2 kilometers (miles) across to 320 kilometers (miles).</p>
<p>3. Typhoon Tip from 1979 now holds the record for the largest typhoon ever, however after all the data has been analyzed, Typhoon Haiyan may overtake it.</p>
<p>4. A typhoon only develops into a super-typhoon after maintaining surface winds exceeding 240 km/h (150 mph) for more than a minute.</p>
<p>5. The Philippines is one of the nations most vulnerable to typhoons and other natural disasters like earthquakes because of its tropical position and its proximity to the Ring of Fire, a geological hazard zone.</p>
